** MediSphereAR**
Welcome to the MediSphereAR GitHub repository! This project leverages Augmented Reality (AR) to revolutionize the way medical and anatomical education is delivered. Our platform provides immersive, 3D visualizations of human anatomy, enhancing comprehension and engagement for students, educators, and professionals in the healthcare industry.

**•	Repository Contents**

1. Interface Website Code: The front-end code for the MediSphereAR website, designed to provide users with easy access to information, downloads, and resources.
   
2. Interface App Code: The codebase for the mobile application, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the AR content. This app includes features like 3D model viewing, interactive animations, and educational overlays.

3. User Manual PDF: A comprehensive guide on how to set up and use MediSphereAR, including technical requirements, installation instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

4. Images and Videos of Working Prototype: Visual documentation showcasing the functionality and features of MediSphereAR. These materials are particularly useful for those unable to experience the AR features in person.

5. Sample QR Codes: QR codes that can be scanned using an iOS device to trigger specific AR experiences. These samples provide a glimpse into the capabilities of MediSphereAR, demonstrating how users can explore and interact with anatomical models.

**•	Full Potential and Trial Videos:**

Since MediSphereAR is an AR-based project, its full potential can best be appreciated through real-world interaction. While we highly recommend experiencing the AR features in person, we understand that this may not always be possible. Therefore, we have included trial videos that showcase the project's core functionalities and user experience.

**•	How to Use**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the User Manual PDF for setting up the interface website and app.
3. Use an iOS device to scan the provided sample QR codes to experience the AR content.
4. For the best experience, use an AR-compatible device to interact with the 3D models and animations.
